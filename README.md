🔐 FORGE B1: Vaultify – Secure Document Storage & Sharing System
The Challenge
Your important documents live everywhere and nowhere. Passport scan in Gmail. Degree certificate on an old laptop. Medical records on your phone. When you need them urgently—applying for a visa, opening a bank account—you're frantically searching through devices, folders, and cloud accounts.
Digital clutter is the new paperwork nightmare.
Build a fortress for your digital life. One secure vault. Organized folders. Controlled sharing with expiry dates. Activity logs showing who accessed what. No more "I can't find the file" or "I'll email it when I get home." Your documents, organized, protected, accessible—but only to those you authorize.
